      <h2 class="originhead">ORIGIN OF LEPCHA PEOPLE</h2>
      <p class="originpara">
        The Lepcha are also called the Rongkup meaning the children of God and
        the Rong, Many Lepcha are also found in western and southwestern Bhutan,
        Tibet, Darjeeling, the Mechi Zone of eastern Nepal, and in the hills of
        West Bengal. The Lepcha people are composed of four main distinct
        communities: the Renjóngmú of Sikkim; the Dámsángmú of Kalimpong,
        Kurseong, and Mirik; the ilámmú of Ilam District, Nepal; and the Promú
        of Samtse and Chukha in southwestern Bhutan.
      </p>
      <p class="originpara">
        The Lepcha people were earlier ruled by Pano (King) Gaeboo Achyok. Pano
        Gaeboo Achyok was instrumental in uniting the Lepcha people and to
        honour him, the Lepcha people celebrate 20th December of every year as
        Pano Gaeboo Achyok celebrations day. Pano Gaeboo Achyok extended the
        Lepcha kingdom from Bhutan in the east to Nepal in the west and from
        Sikkim to the northern tips of present day Bangladesh.

      <h2 class="langhead">LANGUAGE OF THE LEPCHA'S</h2>
      <p class="langpara">
        The Lepcha have their own language, also called Lepcha. It belongs to
        the Bodish–Himalayish group of Tibeto-Burman languages. The Lepcha write
        their language in their own script, called Róng or Lepcha script, which
        is derived from the Tibetan script. It was developed between the 17th
        and 18th centuries, possibly by a Lepcha scholar named Thikúng
        Mensalóng, during the reign of the third Chogyal (Tibetan king) of
        Sikkim.The world's largest collection of old Lepcha manuscripts is found
        with the Himalayan Languages Project in Leiden, Netherlands, with over
        180 Lepcha books.

      <h2 class="relhead">RELIGION OF LEPCHA'S</h2>
      <p class="relpara">
        Most Lepchas are Buddhist, a religion brought by the Bhutias from the
        north, although a large number of Lepchas have today adopted
        Christianity.Some Lepchas have not given up their shamanistic religion,
        which is known as Mun. In practice, rituals from Mun and Buddhism are
        frequently observed alongside one another among some Lepchas. For
        example, ancestral mountain peaks are regularly honoured in ceremonies
        called cú rumfát.Many rituals involve local species. In Sikkim, Lepchas
        are known to use over 370 species of animals, fungi, and
        plants.According to the Nepal Census of 2001, out of the 3,660 Lepcha in
        Nepal, 88.80% were Buddhists and 7.62% were Hindus. Many Lepchas in the
        Hills of Sikkim, Darjeeling and Kalimpong are Christians.

      <h2 class="clotheshead">CLOTHING OF THE LEPCHA'S</h2>
      <p class="clothespara">
        The traditional clothing for Lepcha women is the ankle-length dumbun,
        also called dumdyám or gādā ("female dress"). It is one large piece of
        smooth cotton or silk, usually of a solid color. When it is worn, it is
        folded over one shoulder, pinned at the other shoulder, and held in
        place by a waistband, or tago, over which excess material drapes.
      </p>
      <p class="clothespara">
        The traditional Lepcha clothing for men is the dumprá ("male dress"). It
        is a multicolored, hand-woven cloth pinned at one shoulder and held in
        place by a waistband, usually worn over a white shirt and trousers. Men
        wear a flat round cap called a thyáktuk, with stiff black velvet sides
        and a multicolored top topped by a knot. Rarely, the traditional
        cone-shaped bamboo and rattan hats are worn.

      <h2 class="tendonghead">TENDONG LHO RUM FAAT DANCE</h2>
      <p class="tendongpara">
        It is based on a famous Lepcha folk lore often retold to the new
        generation of Lepchas in the form of lyrical poetry. According to the
        legend, this group dance is performed to save people from the onslaught
        of mighty, mountainous rivers, First, the Lepchas living on the Tendong
        Hill in South Sikkim are reported to have offered prayers to the God
        through this dance. They desired the almighty to save them from the
        disaster of rising water. As per folklore, God came as a bird and began
        sprinkling sacred millet beer on water. Soon, the level of water
        subsided and people heaved a sigh of relief.
