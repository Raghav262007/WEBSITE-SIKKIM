      <h2 class="originhead">ORIGIN OF NEPALI DANCES</h2>
      <p class="originpara">
        Legends state that dances in this country originated in the abode of
        Lord Shiva â€” the Himalayas, where he performed the tandava dance.This
        indicates that dance traditions of Nepal are very ancient and unique.
        With altitudes and ethnicity, the dances of Nepal slightly change in
        style as well as in the costumes.

      <h2 class="langhead">LANGUAGE OF THE NEPALI'S</h2>
      <p class="langpara">
        As per the 2011 census, 123 languages are spoken in Nepal. Nepal's
        linguistic heritage has evolved from three major language groups:
        Indo-Aryan, Tibeto-Burman, and indigenous. The major languages of Nepal
        (percent spoken as mother tongue) are Nepali (44.6%), Maithili (11.7%),
        Bhojpuri(6%), Tharu (5.8%), Tamang (5.1%), Nepal Bhasa (3.2%), Magar
        (3%) and Bajjika (3%) Kirat-Sunuwar, Limbu, Rai, Gurung.
        <br /><br />
        Nepali, written in Devanagari script, is the official national language
        and serves as lingua franca among Nepalese ethno-linguistic groups.
        Extinct languages of Nepal include Kusunda, MaWalinga and Waling.

      <h2 class="relhead">RELIGION OF NEPALI'S</h2>
      <p class="relpara">
        The 2011 census identified 81.6% of the population being Hindu. Buddhism
        was practiced by about 9% of the population. About 4.2% practice Islam
        and 3.6% of the population follows the indigenous Kirant religion.
        Christianity is practiced officially by less than 1.0%.
        <br /><br />
        Hindu and Buddhist traditions in Nepal go back more than two millennia.
        In Lumbini, Buddha was born, and Pashupatinath temple, Kathmandu, is an
        old and famous Shiva temple of Hindus. Nepal has several other temples
        and Buddhist monasteries, as well as places of worship of other
        religious groups. Traditionally, Nepalese philosophical thoughts are
        ingrained with the Hindu and Buddhist philosophical ethos and
        traditions, which include elements of Kashmir Shaivism, Nyingma school
        of Tibetan Buddhism, works of Karmacharyas of Bhaktapur, and tantric
        traditions.
        <br /><br />
        Tantric traditions are deep rooted in Nepal, including the practice of
        animal sacrifices. Five types of animals, always male, are considered
        acceptable for sacrifice: water buffalo, goats, sheep, chickens, and
        ducks. Cows are very sacred animals and are never considered acceptable
        for sacrifice.

      <h2 class="festivalhead">FESTIVAL OF NEPALI'S</h2>
      <p class="festivalpara">
        Several of the festivals of Nepal last from one to several days. As a
        predominantly Hindu and Buddhist nation, most of the Nepalese festivals
        are religious ones. The festivals of Nepal have their roots in Hinduism
        as more than 80% of the population of the country is Hindu. Buddhism,
        the second-largest religion of the nation which accounts for 9% of the
        population, has influenced the cultural festivals of Nepal. Dashain or
        Vijaya Dashami is the longest and the most important festival of Nepal.
        Generally Dashain falls in late September to mid-October, right after
        the end of the monsoon season. It is "a day of Victory over Demons".
        <br /><br />
        The Newars celebrate the festival as Mohani, Tihar or Dipawali, Holi,
        Saraswati Puja, Rakshabandhan, Bhai Dooj, Janmashtami, Gai Jatra, Nag
        Panchami, Teej, Chhath, Kartik Poornima, Maghe Sankranti,or Makar
        Sankranti Maha Shivratri and Chhechu are widely celebrated important
        festivals of Nepal. New Year's Day of the lunar calendar Nepal Sambat
        occurs in November. Several Jatras take place throughout the year and
        public holidays are declared in some regions.
        <br /><br />
        Other important festivals include Buddha Purnima (the celebration of the
        birth of Buddha) Maha Shivaratri (a festival of Lord Shiva) and during
        Maha Shivaratri festivities, some people consume excessive drinks and
        smoke charas.Sherpas, mostly located at higher altitudes and in the
        Mount Everest region, celebrate Mani Rimdu, for the good of the world.
        <br /><br />
        Most festivals include dancing and music, and a variety of special foods
        are consumed during festivals and on special occasions.
        <br /><br />
        The Sagan ceremony is the ritualized presentation of five food items
        (boiled egg, smoked fish, meat, lentil cake and rice wine) to a person
        which is done to bring good fortune as per Tantric tradition

    <div id="maruni">
      <h2 class="marunihead">MARUNI DANCE</h2>
      <p class="marunipara">
        It is one of the oldest and popular group dance forms of the Nepali
        community, usually performed by three male and three female dancers. In
        good old days, the role of Maruni, essentially a female character, was
        enacted by a male. With the change in customs and traditions, female
        dancers are now performing such a central role. It is performed during
        the festival of Tihar in the courtyard of each house. The steps of the
        dancers look very graceful in the background of soothing songs ably
        supported by musical instruments such as Harmonium, Madal, Flute and
        Ghoongur

      <p class="dhaanpara">
        This group dance performed by four men and four women with the backing
        of harmonium, madal, flute and ghoongur shows the symbol of good and
        firm spirit of farmers against rain and scorching heat. In order to
        break the monotony of routine field work, men and women attempt
        merrymaking through song and dance. It is a ritualistic dance performed
        by the youth and old alike in traditional costumes, since time
        immemorial.
