      <p class="cultpara">
        Sikkim's Nepalese majority celebrate all major Hindu festivals,
        including Tihar (Diwali) and Dashain (Dashera). Traditional local
        festivals, such as Maghe Sankranti, Sakela , Chasok Tangnam and Bhimsen
        Puja, are popular. Losar, Saga Dawa, Lhabab Duechen, Drupka Teshi and
        Bhumchu are among the Buddhist festivals celebrated in Sikkim. During
        the Losar (Tibetan New Year), most offices and educational institutions
        are closed for a week. <br /><br />
        Sikkimese Muslims celebrate Eid ul-Fitr and Muharram.Christmas has been
        promoted in Gangtok to attract tourists during the off-season.
        <br /><br />
        Western rock music and Indian pop have gained a wide following in
        Sikkim. Nepali rock and Lepcha music are also popular.Sikkim's most
        popular sports are football and cricket, although hang gliding and river
        rafting have grown popular as part of the tourism industry

      <h2 class="folkhead">WHAT ARE FOLK DANCES ?</h2>
      <p class="folkpara">
        A folk dance is a dance developed by people that reflect the life of the
        people of a certain country or region.Not all ethnic dances are folk
        dances. For example, ritual dances or dances of ritual origin are not
        considered to be folk dances. Ritual dances are usually called
        "Religious dances" because of their purpose. The terms "ethnic" and
        "traditional" are used when it is required to emphasize the cultural
        roots of the dance. In this sense, nearly all folk dances are ethnic
        ones. If some dances, such as polka, cross ethnic boundaries and even
        cross the boundary between "folk" and "ballroom dance", ethnic
        differences are often considerable enough to mention.

        Dance is a medium to showcase rich history and heritage <br /><br />
        The entire population of Sikkim can be broadly divided into three major
        groups :
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Bhutias</li>
        <br />
        <li>Nepalis</li>
        <br />
        <li>Lepchas</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="communitypara">
        These communities have their own distinct language, cultural programs
        and dance forms. <br /><br />
        Folk dances of Sikkim go together with the tunes of many musical
        instruments
