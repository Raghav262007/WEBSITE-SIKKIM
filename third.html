      <h2 class="langhead">LANGUAGE OF THE BHUTIA'S</h2>
      <p class="langpara">
        The language spoken by the Bhutias in Sikkim is Sikkimese, which is 85%
        mutually intelligible with Tibetan and Dzongkha, the language of Bhutan.
        <br /><br />
        Most Bhutias practice the Nyingma school, followed by the Kagyu school
        of Tibetan Buddhism. The Bhutias are spread out over Nepal, Bhutan, and
        the state of Sikkim and districts of Kalimpong and Darjeeling in India.
      </p>

    <div id="origin">
      <h2 class="originhead">ORIGIN OF BHUTIA PEOPLE</h2>
      <p class="originpara">
        The Bhutia are a community of Sikkimese people of Tibetan ancestry, who
        speak Lhopo or Sikkimese, a Tibetan dialect fairly mutually intelligible
        with standard Tibetan. In 2001, the Bhutia numbered around 70,300.
        Bhutia here refers to Sikkimese of Tibetan ancestry; in contrast, the
        Bhotiya are a larger family of related Tibetan peoples in northeastern
        Nepal of which the Bhutia are one member group.
      </p>
      <p class="originpara">
        The ancestors of the Bhutia migrated from Tibet to north eastern Nepal,
        Sikkim, Darjeeling, Kalimpong, and other parts of modern-day Nepal,
        India and Bhutan. They migrated through the different passes ("La" in
        Tibetan means "hill") in the Himalayas. Geographical indications in the
        name of Bhutias' last names are common. In Northern Sikkim, for example,
        where the Bhutias are the majority inhabitants, they are known as the
        Lachenpas or Lachungpas, meaning inhabitants of Lachen or Lachung
        respectively.
      </p>
      <p class="originpara">
        Bhutia aristocrats were called Kazis after similar landlord titles in
        neighboring regions, especially in modern-day Bangladesh. This feudal
        system was an integral part of the Chogyal monarchy prior to 1975, when
        Sikkim was an independent monarchy; the ruling dynasty of the Kingdom of
        Sikkim before the mid-1970s plebiscite was the Bhutia Namgyal dynasty.
        Among the Bhutias, the Lachenpas and Lachungpas have their own
        traditional legal system called the "Dzumsa" which means the meeting
        place of the people. The Dzumsa is headed by the village headman known
        as the Pipon. People of North Sikkim have been given full protection by
        the state government by deeming a status of Panchayat ward and the
        Pipon, a status of Panchayat head.

      <p class="relpara">
        The Bhutias are followers of Vajrayana Buddhism, mainly the Nyingma and
        Kagyu schools. The main festivals observed by them are Losar and
        Losoong. The first week of February is usually the time of Losar as it
        marks the start of the Tibetan New Year. Fire dances are common in the
        evenings during Losar. Losoong is usually celebrated as the end of the
        Tibetan year and falls at the end of the tenth Tibetan lunar month
        (usually December). It is the most important festival among the Bhutias
        in India, and is marked by the traditional Chaan dancing and
        merry-making. Losoong is celebrated across the monasteries in Bhutan,
        Nepal and India. In Sikkim, during the festival of Losoong, often dance
        forms depict narrativized tales from the life of Padmasambhava or Guru
        Ugyen.
      </p>
      <p class="relpara">
        Monasteries of the Bhutias dot various places in India, most notably the
        Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim and the Bhutia Busty Monastery or Karma
        Dorjee Chyoling Monastery, which is also the oldest Monastery in
        Darjeeling.

      <h2 class="clotheshead">CLOTHING OF THE BHUTIA'S</h2>
      <p class="clothespara">
        The traditional outfit of Bhutias is the bakhu (similar to the Tibetan
        chuba, but sleeveless), which is a loose cloak type garment fastened at
        the neck on one side and near the waist with a silk/cotton belt. Male
        members array the bakhu with loose trousers. Womenfolk wear the bakhu
        with a silken full sleeve blouse called a honju; a loose gown type
        garment fastened tight near the waist with a belt. In the front portion,
        a loose sheet of multicolored woolen cloth with exotic geometric designs
        is tied. This is called the pangden and is a symbol of a married woman.
        This traditional outfit is complemented by embroidered leather boots
        worn by both men and women.
      </p>
      <p class="clothespara">
        Bhutia women enjoy a much higher status than their counterparts from
        other communities. Both women and men have a weakness for gold in its
        purest form and, traditional jewelry is mostly made of 24 carat (100%)
        gold.

      <p class="singhipara">
        In this group dance five boys led by a herdsman dance like legendary
        Snowlion. The snowlion is a significant cultural symbol of the state.
        The presence of two snowlions dancing under the guidance of a herdsman
        looks extremely attractive and enchanting to the viewers. Musical
        instruments (without any songs) used are Drum, Cymbal, Yarka and
        Yangjey.

      <h2 class="denzonghead">DENZONG-NEH-NA DANCE</h2>
      <p class="denzongpara">
        This group dance comprising of boys and girls is performed to pay homage
        to the past saints such as Guru Rimpoche and present saints in order to
        get their blessings. The musical instruments which support the graceful
        steps of the dancers are: Flute, Yangjey, Drum and Yarka.

    </div>

    <div id="tashi">
      <h2 class="tashihead">TA-SHI-YANG-KU DANCE</h2>
      <p class="tashipara">
        A group of boys and girls through this dance try to invoke benign
        deities to shower fortunes on their home. They remember some animal
        deities also to bring good fortune and prosperity to the people. It is
        also performed during the consecration of a new house and to bless a
        newly married couple.

    <div id="tashishabdo">
      <h2 class="tashishabdohead">TASHI SHABDO DANCE</h2>
      <p class="tashishabdopara">
        This age old group dance beautifully and gracefully shows the custom of
        offering Khadas (scarf) on auspicious occasion. The white scarf
        exchanged by the members of the group during the course of dance is
        basically a symbol of peace, purity and prosperity. The dancers dance to
        the melodious tunes duly supported by musical instruments such as Yarka,
        Drum, Flute and Yangjey.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="guru">
      <h2 class="guruhead">GURU-CHINLAP DANCE</h2>
      <p class="gurupara">
        Through this particular group dance performed by boys and girls, due
        respect is shown to the various Buddhist Gurus and Saints of Sikkim and
        their blessing is requested for overall peace, prosperity and happiness.
        Exchange of Khadas also takes place between the dancers during the
        course of the dance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="yak">
      <h2 class="yakhead">YAK CHHAM DANCE</h2>
      <p class="yakpara">
        Through this group dance performed by four male dancers under the
        command of a herdsman, utility of Yak for a common man living in high
        altitude areas is shown. The dance begins in slow and measured steps to
        the clash of cymbals and the sound of the trumpets. The group dance
        always makes a powerful impact on the audience and appears very
        attractive to the children. Though Chhams are performed in all the
        monasteries of Sikkim, the ones performed at Pemayangtse, Rumtek and
        Enchey being more impressive draw large audience.
